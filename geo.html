                In Washington state 50 miles northeast of Vancouver and 33 miles west of Mount Adams rests the volcano most likely
                to erupt in the
                contiguous United States: Mount Saint Helens. Like other mountains in the cascades, Mount Saint Helens formed as a
                result of
                the volcanism produced by the Juan de Fuca plate subducting under the North American plate off of the Pacific
                Coast. While it is
                famous for its 1980 eruption, Mount Saint Helens has had many volcanically active periods throughout its 275,000
                year
                existence.
                (https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mount-st.-helens/geology-and-history-summary-mount-st-helens)
          
              </p>
              <p>
                As a matter of fact, it reached its peak height of 9,677 feet (prior to the most recent eruption) as the result of
                a series of lavaflows
                which deposited great quantities of andesite and basalt around 3,000 years ago. Additionally, regular eruptions
                which released dacite
                lavas were intersperesed between the andesite and basalt eruptions. Prior to these recent series of deposits and
                growth, the area consisted
                of a collection of relatively small dacite domes, surrounded by fans of volcanic debris.

              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the relatively low energy lavaflow events that created much of the mountain that remains today,
                Mount Saint Helens has seen
                periods of explosive volcanic activity. For example, between 3,300 and 3,500 years ago massive amounts of tephra
                were violently expelled from
                the area. In fact, the eruption that set this period off was so violent and voluminous (four times larger than the
                most recent eruption), that
                material has been found as far as 590 miles away.

                On May 18th of 1980, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake one mile beneath Mount Saint Helens triggered the largest slope failure in recorded history. 
                3.3 billion cubic yards of debris were released from the northern flank of Mount Saint Helens and traveled at 70 to 150 miles per hour, 
                burying North Fork Toutle River to an average depth of 150 feet. Starting about a month prior to the slide the first sign of volcanic or
                seismic activity manifested as a sequence of relatively small earthquakes. 
                
                </p>
                <p>
                Over the next couple of weeks, these small earthquakes steadyily 
                continued and on March 27th culminated with the first volcanic eruption in over 100 years in the form of steam explosions. These explosions 
                blasted a 75 meter wide crater into the mountain's summit ice cap. The crater continued to grow and eventually stretched 400 meters wide. 
                The steam blasts continued but tapered off through April, eventually stopping altogether on April 22nd. A bulge on the northen surface 
                of the mountain was growing, indicating that a cryptodome was most likely beneath the surface of the mountain was inflating with magma. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Other than continued relatively small earthquakes, the mountain was quiet until May 7th when small steam and ash eruptions resumed. This brings
                us within the fourteen day window prior to the major eruption that is featured on the map. By this time, 10,000 small earthquakes had shaken 
                the mountain and the deformation on the northern surface and swelled 450 feet, creating a remarkable bulge. This type of deformation (although
                not always on this scale) along with a series of small to medium earthquakes are typical events leading to an explosive eruption of a composite 
                volcano. The small steam and ash eruptions, accompanied by medium sized earthquakes centralized around the northern flank of the mountain 
                continued until May 17th. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the early morning hours of May 18th, our 5.1 magnitude earthquake triggered the largest slope failure in recorded history. The bulge that
                  had been growing on the northern flank of the mountain slid away, which triggered a series of catastrophic events. The cryptodome which had 
                  been inflating with magma and increasing in pressure suddenly found itself depressurized. This nearly instant depressurization resulted in 
                  a lateral blast, through the sliding debris. Hot debris from the blast accelerated to 300 miles per hour and blew past the sliding debris from 
                  the slope failure. The blast flattened trees, destroyed, and buried the landscape in the areas surrounding the northern flank. Within a few hours, 
                  the depressurization of the magma system sent pyroclastic flows down the mountain at 80 miles per hour and a massive pillar of ash and tephra 
                  into the sky. https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mount-st.-helens/1980-cataclysmic-eruption
